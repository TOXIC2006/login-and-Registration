# login-and-Registration
Simple Login and Registration System
This project provides a basic front-end template for a user login and registration system. It consists of two static HTML pages styled with internal CSS.

Features
User Registration Page (registraion.html): A form for new users to create an account. It includes fields for:

Username

Email

Contact Number

Address

Password

Gender

Date of Birth

User Login Page (login.html): A simple form for existing users to sign in. It includes fields for:

Username

Password

Basic Styling: Each page is styled using internal CSS to provide a clean and user-friendly interface.

Easy Navigation: Users can easily navigate between the login and registration pages using hyperlinks.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the web pages.

CSS3: For styling the forms and layout.

How to Use
Download the files: Save both login.html and registraion.html to the same folder on your local machine.

Open in Browser: Open either of the HTML files in your preferred web browser to view the pages.

Navigate: Use the "Login" or "Register--Here" links to switch between the two pages.

Note: This is a front-end-only project. The forms do not have back-end functionality to process or store user data.

Future Enhancements
Here are some suggestions for improving and extending the project:

JavaScript Validation: Add client-side form validation using JavaScript to ensure users enter valid data.

Back-End Integration: Connect the forms to a back-end server (e.g., using Node.js, Python with Flask, or PHP) to handle user authentication and data storage.

Database: Integrate a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB to persist user information.

Improved UI/UX: Refine the CSS or use a framework like Bootstrap for a more modern and responsive design.
